# enigma
Using LSTMs to crack ciphers such as caesar cipher, vigenere cipher and enigma

- Currently only works on caesar and vigenere cipher with close to 100% accuracy after a few epochs of training
- enigma.ipynb contains the model for training
- inp.py is used to generate the cipher from some random text
- inp.txt is cipher file and out.txt is the decrypted text file

The ultimate goal is to achieve a decent accuracy on enigma but is difficult and would require a deep LSTM architecture.
